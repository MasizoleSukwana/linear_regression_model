# AI Linear Regression Model - Assignment 2
The goal of this assignment is to create a simple AI model for linear regression using the Rust programming
language and the burn library. The model should predict the output of the function y = 2x + 1 using
synthetic data for training. The programming language used to create the AI Model for linear regression is Python, and this mini project is for exploring how to use Rust Rover IDE and integrate it to GitHub to push, commit, write code, continuously update it, and execute/debug it.

To ensure a proper setup, the following is required.
To run the project, the user needs to have a GitHub account, which can be created on the URL: https://github.com/
The user needs to have access to the Repository/Project URL: https://github.com/MasizoleSukwana/linear_regression_model.git
After opening the Repo/Project URL, click the green "Code" button, open the dropdown arrow, and select CodeSpaces
Click the Add/Create codespaces icon for an environment to be created in the cloud
The CodeSpaces dev environment is prepared/set-up so that the user can run/execute the project

After the environment is prepared/set-up, on the Terminal tab, after this path: @MasizoleSukwana âžœ /workspaces/linear_regression_model (main) $, the user must type the code line then press Enter: Do this for all the code lines
git pull

git add linear_regression_model.py
git commit -m "Added linear regression model"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

The challenges faced with this project is that the code could not run successfully, initially, when the code was set up in Rust Rover, there was an error when Building the code

Upon investigating the error, an additional application such as Visual Studio was required, which, unfortunately, I could not install because the laptop I am working on is a Work laptop and requires Admin rights for some installations.
Another challenge was that I had never worked with Rust Rover before. I am not a programmer, so I had to figure it out with the assistance of ChatGPT
Sharing the code from Rust Rover to Github was an issue as well because I used the GitHub Web version, not the desktop version, but eventually, I was able to share the project
Aftee sharing the project from Rust Rover to GitHub Web Version, I had to create the Main file, with the same code as added and indicated in Rust Rover main.rs file, but in GitHub i created a python version/file instead

I have learned to navigate through AI Tools such as ChatGPT to do setup on the applications involved, including GitHub. I have also relied on the AI tools to get the code that I could use to generate the linear regression model
I am also getting familiar with the GitHub environment and how it works; with time, I believe I will get better.
I got introduced to Rust Rover IDE, a new application I didn't even know existed
I am learning how to work with the code and how to read the code with little to no understanding.
